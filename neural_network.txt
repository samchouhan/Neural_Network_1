A neural network is a brain-inspired computing system using interconnected nodes
 (neurons) in layers to recognize patterns, learn from data, and make predictions,
  functioning as a core part of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to solve complex tasks like image recognition and language processing by adjusting connection strengths (weights) to minimize errors.  

# NOTE -> A neural network is multiple linear regressions + non-linearity.


  STRUCTURE:
  It consists of an input layer then a hidden(processing) layer and then an output layer.

  NEURONS:
  Each neuron(node) recieves an input processes it and passes it to the output layer.

  WEIGHTS:
  The connection between each neuron is called weights, these weights
  change their values while the model is learning,signifying connection
  strengths.

Learning (Training):
->Feed data through the network (forward pass). 
->Calculate the error (difference between prediction and actual). 
->Propagate the error backward (backpropagation) to find how much each weight contributed. 
->Adjust weights to reduce future errors (weight update). 

CORE Components of NEURAL NETWORK
-> weights
-> bias
-> loss function
-> gradient descent
